# Treatments are applied according to order in this file starting form the top treatment going down the list. If user
# gets assigned to one of the treatments then he is removed from further assigning. Treatments allow for variants, that
# is multiple A/B(/C/D...) versions of treatments designed for similar users. Treatment assignment is conducted as
# follows:
#     1. If treatment has variants then eligible users are randomly assigned to one of the variants.
#     2. Rules applied in order of presence in file.
#         - users are filtered according to `conditions`
#         - users are sorted in descending order according to `order_policy`
#         - top `limit_per_code` users get assigned to `campaign_code`, applied to variant
#     3. If `order_policy` is not specified for rule then treatment's `order_policy` is used.
#     4. Only `treatment_size` users can be picked for treatment variant (overrides `limit_per_code` if needed).
#
#     `treatment_size`: desired maximum size of the treatment, can be omitted - then no limit, limit is applied per
#        variant
#     `order_policy`: sql-style string describing ordering variable based on which campaigns without overwritten order
#         policies are picked, must be specified
#     `rules`: specific rules describing conditions to pick treatments,
#     `variant`: each user is randomly assigned to one of the variants, if not specified then rule is part of all
#         variants
#     `conditions`: sql-like conditions used to filter users before assigning rules
# add a line of comments
