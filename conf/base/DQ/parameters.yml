# Configuration to specify all the things needed to run the data quality pipeline
# Params:
# `features_for_dq`:
#    key: dataset name
#    value: List of dict containing 2 keys:
#     - `feature`: name of the feature to be processed.
#                 If you specify asterisk (*) e.g. feature: "*", it will process all "numeric" columns.
#                 You can still put outlier formula per individual column (see example below).
#                 You can also process non numeric column by specifying the feature after the * (see example below).
#
#     - (optional) `outlier_formula`: SQL logic to count the outlier value.
#                                     You can use {col} as placeholder for current column name (see the example below)
#
#    Example (this will process all columns in `l4_touchpoints_to_call_center_features`
#    and run the outlier formula the specified column):
#
#    l4_touchpoints_to_call_center_features:
#      - feature: '*'
#      - feature: sum_touchpoints_number_of_calls_on_cc_sum_weekly_last_week
#        outlier_formula: "sum(case when {col} < 0 or {col} > 500 then 1 else 0 end)"
#      - feature: subscription_identifier  <-- this will include subscription_identifier in the process
